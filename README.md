This repo will contain the KiCAD design files for a Kinetis KL16 eval board.
The target part is the MKL16Z64VLH4.

Status
------

At present, the schematic has been designed, and all parts have been picked
out. Footprints are all designed, although they should get a final check
before fabbing the board. Placement is partially complete.
